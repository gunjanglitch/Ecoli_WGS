# üß¨ Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) Analysis of *Escherichia coli* MP1

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete **whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis pipeline** using publicly available sequencing data of *Escherichia coli* strain **MP1**.  

The dataset (PRJNA1040820) was generated by the University of Alberta using:
- **Illumina (NextSeq 550)** short-read sequencing (SRR26841613)
  
The main objective of the study was to identify genomic features such as **antimicrobial resistance (AMR)**, **virulence factors**, and **plasmids**.

This repository contains a reproducible workflow for processing the Illumina dataset, including **quality control, trimming, assembly, annotation, and in-silico typing**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Summary
| Step      | Tool Used | Description  |
| :-------- | :------ | :------ |
| SRA Download   | SRA Toolkit      | Raw genetic material of E. coli MP1   |
| SRA to Fastq   | Fasterq-dump       | Standard FASTQ format required for further processes   |
| Primary QC   | Fastqc        | Reads were generally high quality but had adapter sequences that needed trimming   |
| Trimming   | Trimgalore       | Reads are cleaner, with higher average quality  |
| De-Novo Assembly   | Spades       | Reconstructed most of the bacterial genome from short reads   |
| Assembly QC   | Quast       | Confirms completeness and continuity of genome   |
| Genome Annotation   | D-Fast       | Genome Features are now labeled with biological functions   |
| AMR, Virulence, Plasmid Detection   | ABRicate       | Reveals whether this E.coli strain may be pathogenic or resistant   |
| MLST(Sequence Type)   | Mlst (Torsten Seemann)       | Tells about evolutionary lineage and epidemiological relevance   |
| Plasmid Typing   | ABRicate       | Plasmids often carry AMR or Virulence genes   |
| Make BLAST Database + Top Hits  | makeblastdb       | Confirms the presence/identity of detected genes by sequence similarity   |

## üìÑ Conclusion
In this project, I performed whole-genome sequencing analysis of Escherichia coli MP1 (SRX22537245, Illumina NextSeq 550). Starting from raw reads, I carried out quality control, trimming, de novo assembly, assembly evaluation, and genome annotation. The annotated genome was further screened for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, virulence factors, plasmids, and sequence typing (MLST and plasmid typing). Finally, BLAST validation was used to confirm the identity of detected genes.

This comprehensive workflow not only reconstructed a high-quality draft genome of E. coli MP1 but also revealed its potential pathogenicity and resistance profile. Such an analysis is crucial for understanding the genomic basis of virulence, resistance, and evolutionary lineage in clinical and environmental isolates.

*These results demonstrate the pathogenic potential of this *E. coli* strain and highlight its genomic features for downstream comparative and epidemiological studies.*
